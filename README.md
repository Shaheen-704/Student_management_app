# 🎓 Student Achievement Portal with Predictive Analytics
**School of Sciences | Christ University (Lavasa Campus)**

## 🚀 Key "Out-of-the-Box" AI Features

### 1. Heuristic Growth Propensity Model
As an MSc Data Science project, this application implements a **Rule-Based Predictive Model**:
* **Algorithm**: The system analyzes the density of achievements to calculate a "Growth Propensity Score".
* **Logic**: It uses a weighted calculation ($Count \times 22\%$) to forecast a student's engagement trajectory.
* **Dynamic Feedback**: The score is visualized via an animated **Growth Ring** that updates in real-time as new milestones are logged.

### 2. Data Visualization & Bento Dashboard
* **Achievement Distribution**: Integrated **Chart.js** bar charts provide a diagnostic view of achievement categories (Research, Academic, Sports).
* **Institutional Context**: Displays the **Department** (e.g., School of Sciences), Course, and Registration ID prominently for academic verification.
* **Security Layer**: Features mock "Encrypted IDs" and a `@login_required` gatekeeper for sensitive student details.
